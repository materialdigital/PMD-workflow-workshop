    "# Concentration dependent elastic constants\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we demonstrate the new `SQSElasticConstantsList` job, which gets elastic constants as a function of chemical composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "This job works by using special quasirandom structures (implemented by Dominik Gehringer and Jan Janssen) to create cells with the requested chemical composition from a base crystal structure. These are then evaluated for their elastic constants (implemented by Yuri Lysogorskiy). These are fully relaxed and the basic output is the chemical composition and full 6x6 elastic matrix. (More detailed output is available from the underlying `SQSElasticConstants` job stored in HDF5, but user-friendly bindings are not currently implemented.)\n",
    "\n",
    "These components were assembled together in a single job (implemented by Liam Huber) that takes a list of dictionaries giving the desired chemical compositions (e.g. `{'Al': 0.95, 'Mg': 0.04, '0': 0.01}` for 95% Aluminium 4% Magnesium and 1% vacancies) and three reference jobs: a `ref_ham` which says how the structures should be interpreted for forces and energies (e.g. a Lammps job with a particular potential) -- the structure of this job provides the base crystal upon which the chemical compositions are imposed -- and `ref_sqs` and `ref_elastic` which hold the input parameters for the SQS and elastic constant calculation components.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current implementation only facilitates modal run modes and is not heavily tested. The example below takes less than 30 minutes on a single core, so for the purposes of demonstration this is not a serious limitation."
